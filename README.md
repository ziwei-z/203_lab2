We used linear regression to study the relationship between COVID-19 number of deaths and mask mandates by state in the US (in 2020). We used public data and used variables that indicate mask mandate starting dates, length, bar/restaurant closure days, mobility, and public sentiment. We used three models and evaluated to make sure each model complies with the five classical linear model (CLM) assumptions. We observed positive correlation between length of mask mandates with the number of deaths.
